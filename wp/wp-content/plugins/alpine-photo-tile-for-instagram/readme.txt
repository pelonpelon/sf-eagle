Simple, stylish and compact plugin for displaying Instagram photos in a sidebar, post, or page. 

== Description == 
Retrieve photos from a particular Instagram user or tag and display them on your WordPress site using the Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram. 
The photos can be linked to the your Instagram page, a specific URL, or to a Lightbox slideshow. 
Also, the Shortcode Generator makes it easy to insert the Instagram widget into posts without learning any of the code. 
This lightweight but powerful widget takes advantage of WordPress's built in JQuery scripts to create a sleek 
presentation that I hope you will like. A full description and demonstration is available at 
[the Alpine Press](http://thealpinepress.com/alpine-phototile-for-instagram/ "Plugin Demo").

**Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram Features:**

* Display Instagram photos in a sidebar, post, or page
* Multiple styles to allow for customization
* Lighbox feature for interactive slideshow (Fancybox, prettyBox, or ColorBox)
* Simple instructions for adding Instagram users and customizing features
* Widget & shortcode options
* Instagram feed caching/storage for improved page loading

**Quick Start Guide:**

1. After installing the Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram plugin on your WordPress site, make sure it is activated by logging into your admin area and going to Plugins in the left menu.
2. Before using the plugin, you must authorize your WordPress website to access your Instagram account by adding an Instagram user. This can be done by going to *Settings->AlpineTile: Instagram->Add Instagram User* and following the directions on the page.
3. To add the Instagram plugin to a sidebar, go to *Appearance->Widgets* in the left menu.
4. Find the rectangle labeled Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram. Click and drag the rectangle to one of the sidebar containers on the right.
5. Once you drop the rectangle in a sidebar area, it should open to reveal a menu of options. The only required information for the plugin to work is an Instagram Username. Select an available ID and click save in the right bottom corner of the menu.
6. Open another page/window in your web browser and navigate to your WordPress site to see how the sidebar looks with the Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram included.
7. Play around with the various styles and options to find what works best for your site.

== Installation ==

**Instagram Plugin Installation**

1. Go to the *Plugins->Add New* section of the Admin Panel.
2. Either search for "Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram" or upload the `alpine-photo-tile-for-instagram` folder using the upload tool.
3. Go to the *Plugins->Installed Plugins* and activate the "Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram" plugin.

**Add an Instagram User**

4. Instagram is quite protective of its users. Before your WordPress website can retrieve images from Instagram, you must authorize your WordPress site to access your Instagram account. On the *Plugins->Installed Plugins* page, click on "Add User" under "Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram". You will be directed to one of the Instagram plugin's "Add Instagram User" page.
5. Follow the directions on the "Add Instagram User" page to add and save a user to the Instagram plugin. I have included the directions here for reference:
6. Before starting, go to *Instagram.com* and make sure you are logged into the account you wish to add. Once you are logged into Instagram, visit the [Instagram Developer](http://instagram.com/developer/ "Instagram Developer") page.
7. Once on the Instagram website, click on the "Manage Clients" link. If this is the first time you are adding an Instagram app or plugin, Instagram will ask you a few questions. Enter the answers, click "Sign Up", and then click "Manage Clients" again.
8. Register your WordPress site by click the "Register a New Client" button.
9. Fill in the "Register new OAuth Client" form with the infomation shown on the "Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram" plugin's "Add Instagram User" and click "Register":
10. The "Instagram Developer" page will shown a Client ID and Client Secret. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret into the form and click "Add and Authorize New User". You will then be directed to an Instagram page where you can finish the authorization. 

**Using the Instagram Widget**

11. Use the widget like any other widget. Go to *Appearance->Widgets* in the left menu. Find the rectangle labeled "Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram". Click and drag the rectangle to one of the sidebar containers on the right.
12. Customize Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram plugin based on your preference.

**Using the Instagram Shortcode**

13. A shortcode is a line of texted used for loading plugins within WordPress pages or posts. Rather than explaining how to setup the shortcode, I have added a tool to the Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram plugin that generates the shortcode for you. Visit the "Shortcode Generator" on the Instagram plugin's settings page (*Settings->AlpineTile: Instagram->Shortcode Generator*).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**I'm having trouble adding an Instagram user and I keep getting an error message. Can you help?**

There are a number of reasons that the plugin might be unable to retrieve your Instagram user information. The most common problems I have seen are due to the settings on the server that is hosting your WordPress website. To try and deal with these issues, I have created the [Instagram Tool](http://thealpinepress.com/instagram-tool/ "Instagram Tool") and hosted it on my website. The Instagram tools allows you to manually retrieve the Instagram information you need and to enter it into the plugin on the bottom of the Add Instagram User page.

**I'm getting the message "Instagram feed was successfully retrieved, but no photos found". What does that mean?**

This message simply means that while no distinguishable errors occurred, the plugin found your  Instagram feed to be empty.

**Can I insert the Instagram plugin in posts or pages? Is there a shortcode function?**

Yes, you can display Instagram photos in posts or pages using what is called a shortcode. Rather than explaining how to setup the shortcode, I have added a tool to the Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram plugin that generates the shortcode for you. Visit the "Shortcode Generator" on the Instagram plugin's settings page (*Settings->AlpineTile: Instagram->Shortcode Generator*).

**Why doesn't the widget show my most recent Instagram photos?**

By default, the Instagram plugin caches or stores the Instagram feed for three hours (see Caching above). If the new Instagram photos have still not appeared after this time, it is possible that Instagram is responsible for the delay.

**How many Instagram photos can I display?**

The plugin can retrieve and display up to Instagram 100 photos.

**Why does it take so long for the Instagram plugin to load?**

The Instagram plugin actually takes less than a second to load. The reason you may see the loading icon for several seconds is because the Instagram plugin is programmed to wait until all the images and the rest of the webpage are done loading before displaying anything. The intent is for the Instagram plugin to avoid slowing down your website by waiting patiently for everything else to finish loading. If you are still looking to speed up your website's loading time, selecting smaller Instagram photo sizes should always help.

I am a one-man development team and I distribute these plugins for free, so please be patient with me.

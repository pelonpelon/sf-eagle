	<h3>Installation</h3><hr class="notop">
<p>
	&nbsp;Follow these simple steps and Events Calendar will be fully functional and ready for use.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Upload the folder &ldquo;events&rdquo; in your server</strong><br>
	<br>
	If you like, you can change the folder name &ldquo;events&rdquo;, but it&#39;s important to remember that the internal folders names must not be changed. Also do not move the folder called &ldquo;admin&rdquo;.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Import in your database the file &ldquo;events.sql&rdquo; that is in the folder events_DB</strong><br>
	<br>
	Before importing it is always suggested to make a backup of your database<br>

	<br>
	To go to the login page type the full address where you installed Events Calendar, adding /admin.<br>
	<br>
	For example, if you didn&rsquo;t change the folder name, the address will be http://www.yourwebsitehere.com/events/admin<br>
	<br>
	Access credentials are<br>
	<br>
	User: admin<br>
	<br>
	Password: admin</p>
<p>

	<br>
	<strong>Absolute path of Events Calendar installation</strong><br>

<section id="calendars">
	<h3>Calendars</h3><hr class="notop">
<p>	This section allow you to view, add, publish, unpublish and delete all your calendars.<br>
	<br>
	As you can see you can add more than one calendar. i.e. You have two different location where you usually organize events, you can use two different calendars.<br>
	<br>
	You must create at least a calendar item to make the app working.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Adding calendars</strong><br>
	<br>
	It&#39; s easy to add a calendar, just type the name of your calendar and click &quot;Add&quot;. You&#39;ll see your calendar appearing in the list below. A new calendar is never published when created, because it&#39;s empty, it has no events yet, so it would be useless to show it on the app.<br>
	<br>
	If you add more than one calendar, you&#39;ll se a button appearing below the &quot;published/unpublished&quot; icon. There must be a default calendar if you have more than one. The default calendar will be the first appearing when the app is loaded.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Modify a calendar name</strong><br>
	<br>
	To modify a calendar name, just click on &quot;Modify name&quot; and type the new name, then click on &quot;Save&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Publish/Unpublish calendars</strong><br>
	<br>
	It&#39;s easy to publish or unpublish a calendar. If you want to change just one calendar status, you can click on the &quot;published/unpublished&quot; icon and that&#39;s it.<br>
	<br>
	If you need to change more than one calendar status, you can select the calendars you want to publish or unpublish and then click on &quot;Publish&quot; or &quot;Unpublish&quot; on the action bar at the top.<br>
	<br>
	Publishing or unpublishing a calendar, is useful if you need to do some modifications on calendar events and you don&#39;t want people to see that you&#39;re working on it.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Delete calendars</strong><br>
	<br>
	You can also delete one calendar or more.<br>
	<br>
	To delete only one calendar, just click on &quot;Delete&quot; on the corrisponding calendar row. To delete more than one calendar, select the calendars you want to delete and then click on &quot;Delete&quot; on the action bar at the top.<br>
	<br>
	Once you&#39;ve deleted a calendar, all related events will be deleted.</p>
<p>	<strong>Duplicate calendars</strong></p>
<p>	You can also duplicate existing calendars. Avoid losing time to insert a new calendar and its events by duplicating an already existing one (with all the events). You will always be able to edit the duplicated calendar.</p>
<p>	<strong>Manage Events</strong></p>
<p>	To manage your events for each calendar, just click on &quot;Events&quot; on the calendar row for which you want to manage events.</p>
<p>	Once clicked, you&#39;ll find the list of all the events created for that specific calendar. Here you are able to add new events or to modify, publish, unpublish and delete the existing ones.</p>
<p>	To create a new event just click on &quot;Add&quot; on the action bar at the top. A form will open and you&#39;ll be able to insert all the information about the event.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<strong>Create events</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	First you&#39;re asked to insert a title for the event (e.g. &quot;Grand meeting&quot;).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.01cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	Then specify the date of the event. An event can last more than one day, so you can insert &quot;date from&quot; and &quot;date to&quot;. If your event lasts only one day, just fill &quot;date from&quot; field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.01cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	You can also select if it&#39;s a recurring event or not. If it&#39;s a recurring event, you can select one or more days of the week on which the event occurs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.01cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	<span lang="en-GB">Then you can specify a starting time for your event and the ending time too.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.01cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	If you want, you can specify times for each day the event lasts. (e.g. the first day, event starts at 10.00 and ends at 13.00 and restarts from 15.00 to 18.00, but on the second day it starts at 15.00 and ends at 19.00 etc.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	You can also insert the event venue information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	You can optionally add the admission rules, writing all prices for the event or setting it free by clicking on the check below the text field. This information will be shown in the spotlight in the event page.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	You can also specify if there is a fixed number of available seats or if they are unlimited.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Then you&#39;ll be able to add a cover photo, which represents the event and you can choose whether to show or not this photo into the event page. By default it will be shown into the event page and events list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	You can add a detailed description, a complete gallery of photos, a video, with a text, and a map, with a text, for your event, so people will be able to see how to easily reach the event location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	You can also choose to add a link to your online store to allow users to buy tickets for the event and/or a link to a specific website (e.g. the event website).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	The link for the online store will appear as a button on the right side of the event page, while the website link will be shown on the left side of the event page.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Then you can insert the Twitter hashtag related to your event, to show the most recent tweets for the event.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Last but not least, you can insert a search string for Flickr, to show the latest pics uploaded on Flickr related to the event.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Then, just click on &quot;Save&quot;. You&#39;ll be redirected to the events list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<strong>Modify Events</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Modifying events is as easy as creating them. Just click on &quot;Modify&quot; on the chosen event row and you&#39;ll be able to modify all the information about it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<strong>Publish/Unpublish Events</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Performing these operations on events is very fast.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	You can publish/unpublish a single event or more than one at once. To modify a single event status, click on the &quot;published/unpublished&quot; icon on the event row and it&#39;s done, status has been changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	If you want to change status of several events, just select the events for which you want to perform the action and then click on &quot;publish&quot; or &quot;unpublish&quot; on the action bar at the top.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<strong>Delete Events</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	To delete one or more events, just select the chosen events and click on &quot;delete&quot; on the action bar at the top.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<strong>Duplicate Events</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
